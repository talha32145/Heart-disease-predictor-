🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on medical parameters. The app is built using Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn and provides prediction results along with probability scores.

🚀 Features

✅ User-friendly Streamlit interface

✅ Input patient medical details for prediction

✅ Predicts Heart Disease or No Heart Disease

✅ Displays prediction probability (%)

✅ Saves patient details and results to CSV file for record keeping

✅ Includes a loader animation ("Thinking... Answering...") while model generates prediction

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.8+

Streamlit – For web app interface

scikit-learn – For ML model

Pandas & NumPy – For data handling

Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional) – For visualization
